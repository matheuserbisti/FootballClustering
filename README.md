# Football Clustering

## Objective

This project aims to point out what national football league could be considered Europe's 6th best league. 

## Justification

Europe's national leagues are amply regarded as the best in the world, containing the highest level of talent, tactics and competitiveness that football can offer. Usually, the ranking goes as:

1. England (Premier League)
2. Spain (La Liga)
3. Italy (Serie A)
4. Germany (Bundesliga)
5. France (League One)

There are many reasons why these leagues are considered the best ones, but I would like to highlight one especifically: the last team outside of theses 5 nations to win the Champions League (Europe's continental championship) was Porto in the 2003/04 season, almost 20 years ago.

Hence, we came up with the question: "What would be Europe's 6th best league?".


## Choices and Metodology

Considering the history and tradition of their respective teams, we chose Netherlands and Portugal leagues as the candidates for 6th place. That means we'll be confronting data from the "Eredivisie" and "Primeira Liga" in order to make an objective decision on which league is the better one.

Our project was made in May 2021, which means that the last complete season was 2018/19. We could've used data from the 2019/20 season, but considering complications that happened during that time because of the Coronavirus Pandemic, we ultimately decided that the 2018/19 season was the better choice.

Both datasets were retrieved from the www.football-data.co.uk website, containing data from Eredivisie and Primeira Liga 2018/19 season. The data came mostly "clean", which means we didn't had to transform or remove much data. However, we did create new variables to enhance our analysis.

With our data obtained, we then proceeded to study them using Exploratory Analysis, Hypothesis Testing and Clusterization. The details of every analysis can be found on the "Trabalho\_CE2.ipynb" file on this same repository. The whole analysis is written in portuguese, but using a translator should help you, in case you need to read it in another language.

In conclusion, our project points out that both Eredivisie and Primeira Liga can be considered the 6th best league, as it's mostly dependant on the type of spectator you are. If you eager for the highest level possible, the best teams for Eredivisie can provide you exactly that. However, Primeira Liga's teams are much more balanced overall, which translates to a more competitive and disputed championship.
